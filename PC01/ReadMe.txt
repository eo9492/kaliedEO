This was my first real project in ATLS 1300 (after Hello World), and my first time coding in 
about 2 years. I had a lot of fun drawing with turtles here, and its fun to look back at this project 
and see how easy it would be to get rid of so much code with for loops and functions, which I didnt know how 
to do then. 

To run code make sure you have attached image in same folder and hit play! Enjoy!
