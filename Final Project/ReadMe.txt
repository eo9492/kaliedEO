This was my final project for ATLS 1300 and I worked solo on this code over the course
of several weeks. It was my first time working with object oriented programing. 
Ive always loved audio-visuals so here was my first attempt at one. 
I heavily modified Dr Z's robot for one last time and created functions to make it dance 
to Opuio's song 'sneakers' 
This song, I belive, is under a creative commons licencse. 
To run just hit play (make sure snearkers.wav is in running folder)
Enjoy!
