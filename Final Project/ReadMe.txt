This was my final project for ATLS 1300 and I worked solo on this code over the course
of several weeks. It was my first time working with object oriented programing. 
Ive always loved audio-visuals so here was my first attempt at one. 
I heavily modified Dr Z's robot for one last time and created functions to make it dance 
to Opuio's song 'sneakers' 
Unfortunately this song too large for Github. Here is a link to download the song:

To run make sure song and file are both in open folder and hit play! 
Enjoy!
