I created this with my partner Gabriel Valentine.
We created the robot modified from Dr Z's. 

This is a short game utilizing click interactions. 
Goal: get all balls into robot torso. 
To play grab balls with mouse and drop in torso. 
Once you get the first one in the robot will start to move 
and switch directions with each new ball. 
Good luck!
