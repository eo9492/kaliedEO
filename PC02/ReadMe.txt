This was my second project in ATLS 1300, and while we hadn't learned for loops or if statements yet, 
I decdided to refresh my memory on the subjects prior to starting. I really had alot of fun with this one as Ive always
enjoyed animations. 

To run code make sure you have attached image in same folder and hit play! Enjoy!
