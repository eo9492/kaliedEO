For this assignment we had to create a piece of generative art. Dr. Z showed us how to make a 
spirograph, which I thought was awesome so I took the idea and ran with it! 
While it takes forever to run, I find the results really nice and they are so different everytime! 
To run just hit play! 
Remember not all flowers are created equally so please be nice to those who are less beautiful <3 
In the folder is an example of what this code can create.
